This project is part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript)

In this project, I used modules to keep code, well, modular. I tried to keep the global code to a minimum while allowing the game to function.

You can choose to enter your name, for each player. If you do not, it fills in default names.

This game works like classic tic-tac-toe, and will alert you who wins, or if it is a tie.
